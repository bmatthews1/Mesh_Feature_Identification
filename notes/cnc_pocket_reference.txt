In machining, a "pocket" refers to a cavity or depression milled into a workpiece, essentially a hollow area within the material created by removing material using a cutting tool like an end mill, typically with a closed boundary on the sides, allowing for the creation of features like recesses or slots within a part. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Key points about pockets in machining: [1, 2, 3]  

• Process: This operation is called "pocket milling" and is commonly performed on CNC machines where the toolpath is programmed to cut material within a defined boundary to create the pocket. [1, 2, 3]  
• Depth: Pockets can be milled to a specific depth, either fully through the workpiece or just a partial depth depending on the desired feature. [1, 2, 4]  
• Closed boundary: A defining characteristic of a pocket is that it usually has a closed boundary, meaning the sides of the cavity are enclosed by the machined material. [2, 4, 5]  
• Applications: Pockets are used in various applications to create features like screw heads, mounting holes, or complex internal shapes in a part. [1, 3, 4]
